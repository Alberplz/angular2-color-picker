/**
 *  A delegate when intercepting zone operations.
 *
 *  A ZoneDelegate is needed because a child zone can't simply invoke a method on a parent zone. For
 *  example a child zone wrap can't just call parent zone wrap. Doing so would create a callback
 *  which is bound to the parent zone. What we are interested is intercepting the callback before it
 *  is bound to any zone. Furthermore, we also need to pass the targetZone (zone which received the
 *  original request) to the delegate.
 *
 *  The ZoneDelegate methods mirror those of Zone with an addition of extra targetZone argument in
 *  the method signature. (The original Zone which received the request.) Some methods are renamed
 *  to prevent confusion, because they have slightly different semantics and arguments.
 *
 *  - `wrap` => `intercept`: The `wrap` method delegates to `intercept`. The `wrap` method returns
 *     a callback which will run in a given zone, where as intercept allows wrapping the callback
 *     so that additional code can be run before and after, but does not associated the callback
 *     with the zone.
 *  - `run` => `invoke`: The `run` method delegates to `invoke` to perform the actual execution of
 *     the callback. The `run` method switches to new zone; saves and restores the `Zone.current`;
 *     and optionally performs error handling. The invoke is not responsible for error handling,
 *     or zone management.
 *
 *  Not every method is usually overwritten in the child zone, for this reason the ZoneDelegate
 *  stores the closest zone which overwrites this behavior along with the closest ZoneSpec.
 *
 *  NOTE: We have tried to make this API analogous to Event bubbling with target and current
 *  properties.
 *
 *  Note: The ZoneDelegate treats ZoneSpec as class. This allows the ZoneSpec to use its `this` to
 *  store internal state.
