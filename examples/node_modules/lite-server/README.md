# lite-server

Lightweight *development only* node server that serves a web app, opens it in the browser, refreshes when html or javascript change, injects CSS changes using sockets, and has a fallback page when a route is not found.

## Why

BrowserSync does most of what we want in a super fast lightweight development server. It serves the static content, detects changes, refreshes the browser, and offers many customizations.

When creating a SPA there are routes that are only known to the browser. For example, `/customer/21` may be a client side route for an Angular app. If this route is entered manually or linked to directly as the entry point of the Angular app (aka a deep link) the static server will receive the request, because Angular is not loaded yet. The server will not find a match for the route and thus return a 404. The desired behavior in this case is to return the `index.html` (or whatever starting page of the app we have defined). BrowserSync does not automatically allow for a fallback page. But it does allow for custom middleware. This is where `lite-server` steps in.

`lite-server` is a simple customized wrapper around BrowserSync to make it easy to serve SPAs.

## Installation and Usage

The recommended installation method is a local NPM install for your project:
```bash
$ npm install lite-server --save-dev
```

...and add a "script" entry within your project's `package.json` file:
```
# Inside package.json...
  "scripts": {    
    "dev": "lite-server"
  },
```

With the above script entry, you can then start `lite-server` via:
```bash
$ npm run dev
```

### Global Installation

lite-server can be also installed globally, if preferred:
```bash
$ npm install -g lite-server

# To run:
$ lite-server
```

## Custom Configuration

The default behavior serves from the current folder, opens a browser, and applies a HTML5 route fallback to `./index.html`.

lite-server uses [BrowserSync](https://www.browsersync.io/), and allows for configuration overrides via a local `bs-config.json` or `bs-config.js` file in your project.

You can provide custom path to your config file via `-c` or `--config=` run time options:
```bash
lite-server -c configs/my-bs-config.js
```

For example, to change the server port, watched file paths, and base directory for your project, create a `bs-config.json` in your project's folder:
```json
{
  "port": 8000,
  "files": ["./src/**/*.{html,htm,css,js}"],
  "server": { "baseDir": "./src" }
}
```

A more complicated example with modifications to the server middleware can be done with a `bs-config.js` file, which requires the `module.exports = { ... };` syntax:
```js
module.exports = {
  server: {
    middleware: {
      // overrides the second middleware default with new settings
      1: require('connect-history-api-fallback')({index: '/index.html', verbose: true})
    }
  }
};
```

**NOTE:** Keep in mind that when using middleware overrides the specific middleware module must be installed in your project. For the above example, you'll need to do:
```bash
$ npm install connect-history-api-fallback --save-dev
```

...otherwise you'll get an error similar to:
```
Error: Cannot find module 'connect-history-api-fallback'
```

Another example: To remove one of the [default middlewares](./lib/config-defaults.js), such as `connect-logger`, you can set it's array index to `null`:

```js
module.exports = {
  server: {
    middleware: {      
      0: null     // removes default `connect-logger` middleware
    }
  }
};
```

## Known Issues
CSS with Angular 2 is embedded thus even though BrowserSync detects the file change to CSS, it does not inject the file via sockets. As a workaround, `injectChanges` defaults to `false`.
